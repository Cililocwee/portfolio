        My name is <span className="highlight">Corrie Stroup</span>, I'm a
        Frontend Developer based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I have developed
        a variety of different apps from reproductions of popular social media
        websites to business UIs.

        <span className="highlight">Expressive, creative front-ends</span> are a
        passion of mine. In a world increasingly technological, cutting-edge is
        where I like to be; the frontier of pixel-perfection and intuitive UX.

        New stacks, old stacks, all stacks have a time and a place and provide
        value in development.
