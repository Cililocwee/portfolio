      "Notstagram is a clone of Instagram that currently allows users to browse uploaded posts and in future updates will allow users to register an account and upload content. As a proof of concept mock-up, the main features of a social media app such as Instagram are functional: a main feed that reads from the database to maintain the contents and comments and an explore tool on the Discover page that mimics the Discover feature on a robust social media platform. The stack is Firebase on the backend with ReactJS/Typescript on the frontend.",
